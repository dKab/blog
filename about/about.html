        Hi,
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm Dima, frontend developer based in Saint Petersburg, Russia, and this is my blog.
        I am interested in accessibility, static site generators, CSS, HTML, JavaScript, UX, web performance, indieweb and JAMStack.
        That's what I write about mostly, or plan to write about, anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
        The blog is a static site, hence the name ðŸ™‚.
        It's built with <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">11ty</a>; the source code is on <a href="https://github.com/dKab/blog">GitHub</a>.
     </p>
    <p>
    You can connect with me on social media (I would really love that!): <br>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="https://twitter.com/dkabardinov"><img class="icon twitter-icon" src="/assets/graphics/twitter.svg" aria-hidden="true" /> Twitter</a>,
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hold_on_a_sec/"><img class="icon ig-icon" src="/assets/graphics/IG_Glyph_Fill.png" aria-hidden="true" /> Instagram</a>;
        </li>
    </ul>
    or, if you want to be old-fashioned, you can drop me an email on <a href="mailto:dkabardinov@gmail.com">dkabardinov@gmail.com</a>.
    <p>Although I'm not in an active search for a job right now, I'm always open to remote career opportunities.</p>
