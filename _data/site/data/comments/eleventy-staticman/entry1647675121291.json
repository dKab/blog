From what you are describing it sounds like you are sending a request via form submission - with page reload and everything. The idea is that you send an xhr request with JavaScript, that way you won't see a blank page and won't need to implement redirection back to your page. You can check source code of this blog for details as example. Hope it helped. Cheers","replying_to_uid":"7873e2e0-a747-11ec-af80-a162af1eb09f","replying_to":"7","date":1647675121}
